let and const 
ES5 and ES6
ES = ECMASCRIPT

to overcome the limitations of var , let and const are introduced 
var = global scope can be re assign and also can be redeclared .
let can be re assign but cannot re declare 
const cannot be reassign and also cant be redeclared 
let and const are called as  block scope

spread operator/ rest operator: 

... three dots 

spread can be used in normal as well as arrays, can use many number of spread operators 
rest operator can be used in arrays and inside the functions  => put the rest of array elements, we cannot use many operators
must be the last parameter of the function. if not it throws error .

destructuring:

js expression that allows unplug the values from arrays or properties of objects.
datas can be extracted from array , objects , nested objects.
if we have n number of datas , and if we want to extract some particular data of a particular person , then we can go for destructuring 

const { } = variable name

template literals: works same as concatination ... to create a lengthy sentence.
